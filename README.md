## Installing Dependencies: Installing necessary packages.
```
npm install recharts
```
### Step 2: Structuring Your Project

**1. Components**:

**Chart:** Displaying the chart using the selected charting library.

**TimeframeSelector:** Providing UI to switch between different timeframe breakdowns.

**2.Folders**:

**components :**  For all the React components. 

**data       :** For JSON data or data fetching utilities.

**styles     :** For CSS modules or styled components.
### Step 3: Implementing Features

**Chart**:
    - Integrating the selected charting library (e.g., Recharts).
    - Displaying data with support for timeframe breakdown and zooming.
    - Adding click event handlers to display details of clicked data points.

**TimeframeSelector:**
Creating UI controls to switch between daily, weekly, and monthly views.
```
import React from 'react';

const TimeframeSelector = ({ onSelect }) => (
  <div>
    <button onClick={() => onSelect('daily')}>Daily</button>
    #similarly creating buttons weekly and Monthly
  </div>
);

export default TimeframeSelector;
```

### Step 4: Fetching Data JSON Data Handling:

Creating a JSON file or an endpoint to serve chart data.
```
#Example Json
[
  { "timestamp": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z", "value": 10 },
  { "timestamp": "2023-01-02T00:00:00Z", "value": 12 },
  { "timestamp": "2023-01-03T00:00:00Z", "value": 5 }
]
```
### Step 5: Styling

Responsive CSS: Use media queries or a mobile-first approach to ensure the application looks good on all devices.

### Step 6: Testing and Debugging

- Testing the app in different browsers and devices.
- Check functionalities such as timeframe breakdown, zooming, and click events.

### Step 7: Deployment


- **Hosting**: Deployed  app on platform  Vercel.
